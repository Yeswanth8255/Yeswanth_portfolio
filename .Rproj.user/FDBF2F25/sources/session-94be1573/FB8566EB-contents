BIO

This is Yeswanth Chitirala. Currently, I am pursuing Masters in Advanced Data Analytics course. I have completed my under graduation in Mechanical engineering from RVR & JC college of engineering, Guntur, India. As I am very keen on physics and mathematics, I have chosen mechanical stream in my under graduation. After my undergrad I worked in Infosys for three years and worked in Deloitte for one year as ETL developer. I have 4 years of work experience in ETL informatica tool. My background for programming languages is I have worked up on C Programming, python and Oracle SQL. Coming to usage of analytics in my professional career, I used to clean the unprocessed data before transforming the data. As this course work is an extension to my work experience in ETL, I have chosen ADTA program.
